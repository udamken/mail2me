    <string name="generalExplanationLabel">There are two options to create a shortcut to open an email to specified email address.
        Add (1) a link or (2) a widget on your homescreen. The latter is helpful if you do not display labels for the icons on the
        homescreen (as some launchers allow to suppress them).</string>
    <string name="linkExplanationLabel">(1) To add a link please enter the abbreviation to be shown as label and the email
        adress, then press the button to add a link.</string>
    <string name="widgetExplanationLabel">(2) To add a widget go to your homescreen. You can add a mail2me widget the same way as
        you usually add widgets - probably by touching longer on your homescreen.</string>
